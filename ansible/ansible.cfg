# nearly all parameters can be overridden in ansible-playbook
# or with command line flags. ansible will read ANSIBLE_CONFIG,
# ansible.cfg in the current working directory, .ansible.cfg in
# the home directory or /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg, whichever it
# finds first

# if so defined, consider logrotate

# if set, always use this private key file for authentication, same as
# if passing --private-key to ansible or ansible-playbook

# If set, configures the path to the Vault password file as an alternative to
# specifying --vault-password-file on the command line.
